### About

This course shows you practical techniques and strategies for small projects
and large-scale environments. It gives you
concrete examples of systems integration, messaging, web development,
and databases, all in a clear problem/ solution format.

This course concentrates on the Ruby way of developing software,
especially how to use Ruby as a tool for integration. Next we talk about
REST, Web services, asynchronous messaging, and deployment. In the last
part, you'll discover how to manage all forms of dataâ€”from manipulating
structured documents to identity management. Along the way you'll learn
how to use Ruby to build new applications, solve more problems with less
effort, integrate with your existing applications, and give new life to
your legacy systems.
